                BetterScroll is a plugin which is aimed at solving scrolling circumstances on the mobile side (PC
                supported
                already). The core is inspired by the implementation of iscroll, so the APIs of BetterScroll are
                compatible
                with iscroll on the whole. What's more, BetterScroll also extends some features and optimizes for
                performance based on iscroll.
